# Flexi Product Kit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/madetech/solidus_flexi_product_kits.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/madetech/solidus_flexi_product_kits)

Create a product which is composed of other products.

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`
```ruby
gem 'solidus_flexi_product_kits', github: 'madetech/solidus_flexi_product_kits', branch: 'master'
```

Run bundle install as well as the extension intall command to copy and run migrations and
append solidus_flexi_product_kits to your js manifest file

    bundle install
    rails g solidus_flexi_product_kits:install

## Use

To build a bundle (assembly product) you'd need to first check the "Can be part"
flag on each product you want to be part of the bundle. Then create a product
and add parts to it. By doing that you're making that product an assembly.

The store will treat assemblies a bit different than regular products on checkout.
Spree will create and track inventory units for its parts rather than for the product itself.
That means you essentially have a product composed of other products. From a
customer perspective it's like they are paying a single amount for a collection
of products.
